- **View Notes**: All created notes are displayed in a list format, showing the title and content of each note.
- **Delete Notes**: Users can delete individual notes by clicking the delete icon next to each note.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The application is built using the React library, allowing for efficient and modular UI development.
